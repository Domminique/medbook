This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

 ## Deployment
To deploy your application, you have to compile it, and then host the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on a web server. Running ng build --prod will create a [dist] folder in your local repository, copy the files and copy then in a folder called public on the server side. Built Angular applications are very portable and can live in any environment or served by any technology, such as Node, Java, .NET, PHP, and many others.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
